# AWS Cloud introduction
## What is cloud computing
- refers to on-demand delivery of IT resources & applications via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
### before cloud computing
  - need to provision capacity based on guessing theoretical max peaks
  - if didn't meet projected max peaks / exceeded them
    - need to pay for expensive resources that would stay idle
    - or have insufficient capacity to meet needs
### benefits
  - server, databases, storage, higher-level app components can be initiated within seconds
    - can be treated as temporary & desposable resources
    - free from the inflexibility & constraints of a fixed & finite IT infrastructure
  - approach to change management, testing, reliability, & capacity planning is more agile & efficient
### 1 main reason companies move to cloud is due to agility
  - 3 factors that affects agility
    1. speed
        - AWS facilities all over the world can offer global reach with a moment's notice
        - AWS gives benefit without having to make huge investment as data are facilities are closed to customers
          - cost of building data centers are not required
        - new resources are a click away
          - reduces the time it takes to make those resources available to developers from weeks to minutes
    2. experimentation
        - enable ability to safely experiment, develop operations procedures, & practice failure
        - enables operations as code in the cloud
          - AWS allows spinning up servers in minutes for experimenting
          - allows return or re-purpose servers for other experiments
        - with virtual & automatable resources
          - can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, / configurations
          - AWS CloudFormation enables consistent, templated, sandbox development, test, & production environments
            - with increasing levels of operations control
    3. cuture of innovation
        - being able to experiment quickly & having low cost & low risk
          - it allows for more experimentation, which leads to discovery of new configurations & innovations
## Understanding how AWS utilizes agility of cloud computing
- need to look at AWS infrastructure that supports elasticity, scalability, & reliability of computing resources
### AWS Cloud infrastructure
- built around Regions & Availability Zones ("AZs")
  - a region is a physical location in the world
    - have multiple Availability Zones
      - Availability Zones consist of 1 or more descrete data centers
        - each data center has redundant power, networking & connectivity, & is housed in separate facilities
        - Availability Zones offer the ability to operate production apps & databases
          - these are more highly available, fault tolerant, & scalable than a single data center
            - fault tolerant: the ability for a system to remain operational even if some of the components of that system fail
              - it can be seen as the built-in redundancy of an app's components
            - high availability: ensures that systems are always functioning & accessible
              - also ensures downtime is minimized as much as possible WITHOUT human intervention
### Using AWS Cloud
- can take advantage of scalable, reliable, & secure global computing infrastructure to meet requirements
### Elasticity
- it is also a powerful force in Cloud Computing
- it is the power to scale computing resources up / down easily
  - while only paying for the actual resources used
- elastic nature of AWS allows customers to:
  - quickly deploy new apps
  - instantly scale up as workload grows
  - instantly shut down resources that are no longer required
  - scale down & don't pay for the infrastructure
- AWS provides the elastic infrastructure to meet needs
  - needing 1 virtual server / thousands
  - needing computing resources for a few hours / 24/7
### Key benefits of AWS
- is the ability to use services at own pace
- by using AWS, customers can grow, shrink, & adapt their consumption of services
  - to meet seasonal requirements
  - launch new services or products
  - accommodate new strategic directions
- AWS delivers scalable cloud computing platform designed for high availability & dependability
  - providing tools that enable running a wide range of apps
    - AWS tools, Auto Scaling, & Elastic Load Balancing
      - allows app to scale up / down based on demand
      - backed by Amazon's infrastructure
      - have access to compute & storage resources when needed
- can easily deploy system in multiple regions around the world
  - while providing a lower latency & better experience for customers at minimal cost
    - customers can consistently use innovative services & cutting-edge tech
      - without having to go through multiple procurement cycles & expensive evaluations
  - AWS provides capabilities to support virtually any workload
    - giving customers continued access to latest tech
- you retain complete control & ownership over which region the data is physically located
  - makes it easy to meet regional compliance & data residency requirements
  - AWS Cloud provides governance capabilities that enable continuous monitoring of configuration changes to IT resources
  - before cloud computing
    - infrastructure security auditing would often be a periodic & manual process
- AWS offers industry-leading capabilities across facilities, networks, software, & business processes to meet strictest requirements
  - AWS secure data centers use electronic surveillance & multi-factor access control systems
    - data centers are staffed 24/7 by security guards, & access is authorized strictly on a least privileged basis
    - environmental systems are designed to minimize the impact of disruptions to operations
    - multiple geographic reigions & availability zones allow resilience during failure modes
      - including natural disasters or system failure
- AWS assets are programmable resources
  - thus, security policy can be formalized & embedded with the design of the infrastructure
  - AWS helps customers develop high performing & reliable solutions to address most business needs
    - e.g.: offering media services to customers around the world / managing medical devices for a highly decentralized workforce
  - AWS gives customers the tools to implement solutions quickly & with limited friction
  - AWS reliability defined as the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure / service failures
    - it also focuses on the ability to dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demands & mitigate disruptions
    - to achieve reliability, architecture & system must have well-planned foundation
      - that can handle changes in demand & also detect failure & automatically heal itself
    - AWS help achieve greated flexibility & capacity
      - reducing the uncertainty of forecasting hardware needs
      - the scale of AWS gives customers capacity & reliability that is difficult to match by on-premise solutions
- with AWS, no longer need to dedicate valuable resources to building costly infrastructure
  - including purchasing servers, software licenses or leasing facilities
  - by paying for services on an as needed basis
    - allows redirection of focus to innovation & invention
      - reducing procurement complexity & enabling the business to be fully elastic
    - pay-as-you-go pricing allows easy adaptation to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets
      - and improving responsiveness to changes
      - the model allows business to adapt depending on need & not on forecasts
        - reducing the risk / overprovisioning / missing capacity
## Summary
- moving to the cloud is not just about saving costs on IT
  - it's about creating the environment that lets the business thrive
