## How to Use This Repo

1. **Pick a topic folder** from the map above (e.g., `designPatterns/`, `database/`).
2. **Skim the short notes/diagrams first** to refresh concepts, then dive into examples.
3. **Cross-link your learning**:
   - Pair `basics/` with any `languageSpecific/` notes when switching languages.
   - Use `interviewPrep/` alongside `math/` and `designPatterns/` for whiteboard prep.
   - Combine `devops/` + `deployment/` when practicing CI/CD pipelines.
