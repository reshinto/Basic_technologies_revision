# Gamma Categorization
* Design patterns are typically split into 3 categories
  * this is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors
## Creational Patterns
* deal with creation (construction) of objects
* explicit (calling an constructor) vs implicit (Dependency Injection, reflection, etc.)
* wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step by step)
## Structural Patterns
* concerned with the structure (eg class members)
* many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
* stress the importance of good API design
## Behavioral Patterns
* they are all different, no central theme
* using completely different object oriented mechanisms, so will have some overlap
* generally most of the behavioral design patterns are unique in their approach
  * it solves a problem in a particular way
