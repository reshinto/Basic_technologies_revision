// Bridge Implementation
// Define an interface for the Implementation

/**
 * The Implementation defines the interface for all implementation classes. It
 * doesn't have to match the Abstraction's interface. In fact, the two
 * interfaces can be entirely different. Typically the Implementation interface
 * provides only primitive operations, while the Abstraction defines higher-
 * level operations based on those primitives.
