# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Writing tests for production code before writing the actual code
- simple example: writing failing test first before writing the logic

```javascript
function inchesToCentimeters(x) {}

test(inchesToCentimeters(1) === 2.54);
test(inchesToCentimeters(5) === 12.7);
test(inchesToCentimeters(27) === 68.58);
test(inchesToCentimeters(196) === 497.84);
```

## Advantages of TDD

- Ensures code quality
- Forces us to clarify our thinking
- Improves communication between developers
  - Allows new developers to understand the intention from other developers or those who already left the company
    - adding comments to code is good, however, no guarantees that the comments will also be updated together with the code
    - tests provides a concrete medium to express what the code is supposed to do & the different situations where it should produce a certain output
      - if the code changes, tests must also be modified to prevent the tests from failing
- Improves the structure of the production code
  - Requires to think carefully about how the code is arranged
  - Forces to split up large chunks of code into smaller, more testable chunks (thus makes code loosely coupled)
- Allows developers to make worry-free changes
  - if all the test passes, then everything is okay

## Disadvantages of TDD

- Takes longer at first
- TDD is not always a favorite with management
- Need to be careful of writing bad tests

## Basic TDD cycle

1. Write a failing test
2. Write the code but only enough to make the failing code test pass
3. Refactor the code written

## Criteria for a good test

1. Readable
   - Test should be even more readable than the code they cover
   - it should answer "What's the actual behavior?", "What's the expected behavior?", "Why?"
2. Isolated
   - Test in 1 test cannot affect the results of the other tests
3. Thorough
   - Test must cover both generic expected inputs & unexpected or edge case inputs
4. Explicit
   - All the information required to reproduce the results of the test, must be readily accessible to anyone
   - There should be no shared state between components, nothing hidden, everything involved in getting to the final result should be clear & obvious

## 3 types of tests

1. Unit Tests: test very specific, low level pieces of functionality (end users won't really notice or think about directly)
   - Need to have 3 things: A testing environment / test runner, A testing framework, An assertion library
   - tools:
     - Mocha: serves as a test runner and a testing framework
     - Chai: serves as an assertion library
     - Jasmine: serves all
     - Jest: serves all
2. Integration Tests: ensures that the individual pieces of the application work together correctly (e.g. testing if app communicates correctly with a database or api)
   - tools:
     - Mocha & Chai
     - Sinon js:
       - use for creating test doubles
       - provides different functions for creating mocks, stubs, and other test doubles that allow effective integration tests
       - help to verify how something works in isolation
     - Supertest: allows us to run integration tests on our node server without actually starting up the server
       - this is helpful because waiting for a server to start up can dramatically slow down our development
       - it allows us to query our server and get results as if the server was actually running
3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests: ensure the entire app works as seen from the viewpoint of a user
