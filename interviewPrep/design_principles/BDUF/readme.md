# Big Design Up Front (BDUF)

- this is a principle that is perfect for that environment
  - it states that you should spend more time fully designing the application before you even write the first line of code
- Clearly, this says waterfall all over the place, where you can spend the required amount of time completely defining everything, with the hopes that once you start developing, you wonâ€™t spend too much time finding and fixing design flaws
- Of course, like with many of the other principles described here, it is not without its detractors
  - Especially agile developers tend to argue against this one, considering that the ever changing nature of agile life cycles make this principle useless
  - Unless of course, you enjoy spending time designing something that you know will change completely by the end of the project
