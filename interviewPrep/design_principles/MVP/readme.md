# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- it represents the minimum amount of functionality your product needs to have in order to understand how viable it is in reality
- This is a great technique used to understand if finishing and reaching 100% of your desired product is not going to be a waste of your time
  - The output of your MVP phase, usually entails a product that while is not necessarily production ready, it can be used by a focused audience which in turn, can provide the required feedback to understand its viability
