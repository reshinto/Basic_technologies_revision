# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

- It usually means refactoring code by taking something done several times and turning it into a loop or a function
  - DRY code is easy to change, because you only have to make any change in one place
- `Easy to change` doesn’t just mean clean code
  - if you can’t figure out what a variable is for or what a function does based on its name
    - then it’s harder to change it later, when you might not remember exactly how your code works
      - or when somebody else is trying to change your code
- Using descriptive variable names make it easier to understand what the variable contains and in turn make it easier to use or change later on
- A good starting naming convention for your variables and functions would be:
  - singular words for variables containing values
    - i.e: fruit, firstName, favoriteColor
  - plural words for variables containing objects or arrays
    - i.e: fruits, names, myColors
  - a description for variables containing functions
    - ie: logFruits, findPerson, getFavoriteColor
- Conclusion
  - Whenever you finish writing some code, you should always look back to see if there is any way you can DRY it up, including:
    - using descriptive variable names
    - taking repetitive bits of code
    - extracting them into a function or loop
