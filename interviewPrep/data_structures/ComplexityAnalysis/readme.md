# Complexity Analysis

- the process of determining how efficient an algorithm is
  - usually involves finding both the time and space complexity of an algorithm
- it is effectively used to determine how "good" an algorithm is and whether is is "better" than another one

## Time Complexity

- a measure of how fast an algorithm runs
- it is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews
- it's expressed using Big O notation

## Space Complexity

- a measure of how much auxillary memory an algorithm takes up
- it is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews
- it's expressed using Big O notation
