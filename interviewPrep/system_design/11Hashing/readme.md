# Hashing
- hashing is an action that you can perform to transform an arbitrary piece of data into a fixed size value (typically an integer value)
  - in terms of system design, the arbitrary piece of data can be an IP address, username, or HTTP request, anything that can be hashed or transformed into an integer value
## potentional problem with round robin strategy approach of a load balancer
- a client performs a computional heavy request and cache is stored in server a
  - if the same client performs the same heavy request but instead got redirected to a different server, the cache is gone and have to be cached again
### naive solution via hashing
  - first hash the requests that comes into the load balancer
    - then based on the hash value, the request will be redirected to the server located at the hash value
    - by doing so, all request made by the same client will always be redirected to the same server
  - however, other problems can arise when dealing with large scale distributed systems
    - e.g.: servers can die, or a server is overloaded and requires new servers
    - in the case where a new server is added, or when a server fails
      - we would need to modify the hashing logic to produce different hash values for the server locations
        - however, by doing so, all the clients that were redirected to a specific server would change, causing the servers to compute the cache again
  - therefore, this solution does not work the moment a server fails or a new server is added
### Better solution by using Consistent hashing or Rendezvous hashing
## Terms used
### Hashing function
- a funtion that takes in a specific data type (such as a string or an identifier)
  - and outputs a number
- different inputs may have the same output
  - but a good hashing function attempts to mnimize those hashing collisions (equivalent to maximizing uniformity)
- a good hashing function will evenly distribute your data values
- in practice you never write your own hashing function
  - normally use a pre-made industry grade hashing function or hashing algorithm
    - e.g.: MD5, SHA-1, Bcrypt
### Consistent hashing
- a type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash table gets resized
- it's often used by load balancers to distribute traffic to servers
- it minimizes the number of requests that get forwarded to different servers when new servers are added or when existing servers are brought down
- if a server gets removed or is newly added, most of the clients will still be redirected to the same server
- the same server can also be placed at multiple locations to allow more clients to be redirected to it

### Rendezvous hashing
- a type of hashing also coined highest random weight hashing
- allows for minimal re-distribution of mappings when a server goes down
- for every client, it will calculate a score or ranks the servers or destinations
  - the client would then be associated with the highest score or ranking of the server
  - in the event a server fails, a new calculation of the highest score or ranking of the server will be done and thus be associated to the new server
### SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms)
- is a collection of cryptographic hash functions used in the industry
- SHA-3 is a popular choice to use in a system these days
