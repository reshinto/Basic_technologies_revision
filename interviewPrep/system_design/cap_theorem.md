# CAP Theorem
* CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed software system
  * to simultaneously provide more than 2 out of 3 of the following guarantees (CAP)
    * Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance
  * When we design a distributed system, trading off among CAP is almost the first thing we want to consider
  * CAP theorem says while designing a distributed system we can pick only 2 of the following three options:
    ### Consistency
      * All nodes see the same data at the same time
      * Consistency is achieved by updating several nodes before allowing further reads
    ### Availability
      * Every request gets a response on success/failure
      * Availability is achieved by replicating the data across different servers
    ### Partition tolerance
      * The system continues to work despite message loss or partial failure
      * A system that is partition-tolerant can sustain any amount of network failure
        * that doesnâ€™t result in a failure of the entire network
      * Data is sufficiently replicated across combinations of nodes
        * and networks to keep the system up through intermittent outages

* We cannot build a general data store that is
  * continually available, sequentially consistent, and tolerant to any partition failures
  * We can only build a system that has any 2 of these three properties
    * Because, to be consistent, all nodes should see the same set of updates in the same order
      * But if the network suffers a partition
        * updates in one partition might not make it to the other partitions
          * before a client reads from the out-of-date partition after having read from the up-to-date one
            * The only thing that can be done to cope with this possibility is
              * to stop serving requests from the out-of-date partition
                * but then the service is no longer 100% available
