# Consistent Hashing
* Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is one of the fundamental components used in distributed scalable systems
* Hash Tables need a key, a value, and a hash function
  * where hash function maps the key to a location where the value is stored
    > index = hash_function(key)
* Suppose we are designing a distributed caching system
  * Given ‘n’ cache servers, an intuitive hash function would be ‘key % n’
    * It is simple and commonly used
      * But has 2 major drawbacks:
        1. It is NOT horizontally scalable
            * Whenever a new cache host is added to the system, all existing mappings are broken
            * It will be a pain point in maintenance if the caching system contains lots of data
            * Practically, it becomes difficult to schedule a downtime to update all caching mappings
        2. It may NOT be load balanced, especially for non-uniformly distributed data
            * In practice, it can be easily assumed that the data will not be distributed uniformly
            * For the caching system, it translates into some caches
              * becoming hot and saturated while the others idle and are almost empty
        * In such situations, consistent hashing is a good way to improve the caching system
## What is Consistent Hashing?
* Consistent hashing is a very useful strategy for distributed caching system and DHTs
* It allows us to distribute data across a cluster in such a way
  * that will minimize reorganization when nodes are added or removed
  * Hence, the caching system will be easier to scale up or scale down
* In Consistent Hashing, when the hash table is resized
  * (e.g. a new cache host is added to the system)
  * only ‘k/n’ keys need to be remapped where ‘k’ is the total number of keys
    * and ‘n’ is the total number of servers
  * Recall that in a caching system using the ‘mod’ as the hash function, all keys need to be remapped
* In Consistent Hashing, objects are mapped to the same host if possible
  * When a host is removed from the system, the objects on that host are shared by other hosts
  * when a new host is added, it takes its share from a few hosts without touching other’s shares
## How does it work?
* As a typical hash function, consistent hashing maps a key to an integer
* Suppose the output of the hash function is in the range of [0, 256)
* Imagine that the integers in the range are placed on a ring such that the values are wrapped around
* Here’s how consistent hashing works:
  1. Given a list of cache servers, hash them to integers in the range
  2. To map a key to a server
      * Hash it to a single integer
      * Move clockwise on the ring until finding the first cache it encounters
      * That cache is the one that contains the key.
