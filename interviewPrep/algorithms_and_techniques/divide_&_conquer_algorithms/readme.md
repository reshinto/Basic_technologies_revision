# Divide & Conquer algorithms
1. Divide problem into several smaller subproblems
    - normally, the subproblems are similar to the original 
2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively
    - base case: solve small enough problems by brute force
3. Combine the solutions to get a solution to the subproblems
    - and finally a solution to the original problem 
4. Divide and Conquer algorithms are normally [recursive](https://github.com/reshinto/Basic_technologies_revision/tree/master/algorithms_and_techniques/recursion)
